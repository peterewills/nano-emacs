## helm modeline

Would be nice to have the nano-modeline enabled in helm. Also, replace the existing
modelin (on the bottom of the buffer) with the usual dashes.

## EIN modeline

Only thing left to do here is figure out why, when I edit a notebook, the "unsaved"
status (which should show up as `**`) doesn't change in the modeline. The modeline gets
it from `nano-modeline-status`.
